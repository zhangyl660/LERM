## Abatract
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is fragile in scenarios with insufficient labeled samples. A vanilla extension of ERM to unlabeled samples is Entropy Minimization (EntMin), which employs the soft-labels of unlabeled samples to guide their learning. However, EntMin emphasizes prediction discriminability while neglecting prediction diversity. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we rethink the guidance information to utilize unlabeled samples. By analyzing the learning objective of ERM, we find that the guidance information for the labeled samples in a specific category is the corresponding *label encoding*. Inspired by this finding, we propose a Label-Encoding Risk Minimization (LERM). It first estimates the label encodings through prediction means of unlabeled samples and then aligns them with their corresponding ground-truth label encodings. As a result, the LERM ensures both prediction discriminability and diversity and can be integrated into existing methods as a plugin. Theoretically, we analyze the relationships between LERM and ERM, as well as between LERM and EntMin. Empirically, we verify the superiority of the LERM under several label insufficient scenarios.

## Installation

We implement SSL and UDA in the Pytorch framework and implement SHDA in the Tensorflow framework.

For SSL and UDA

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For SHDA

```shell
conda create -n shda
conda install pandas==1.1.5
conda install scikit_learn==1.5.0
conda install scipy==1.5.2
conda install tensorflow==2.16.1
conda install tensorflow_gpu==1.15.0
```



## Usage
You can find scripts in the directory `SSL`, `UDA`, and `SHDA`.
